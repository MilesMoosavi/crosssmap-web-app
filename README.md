# Crossmap Web App

**Crossmap** is an interactive web application that allows users to place nodes on a map and adjust their properties, such as radius, using simple controls. The application currently features a node placement tool, zoom functionality, and an interactive map view, with plans for backend integration and further enhancements.

The app is being developed to optimize node placements (e.g., Wi-Fi hotspots) using Quantum optimization algorithms through Qiskit. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and future development will integrate a Flask API or Docker container to run the optimization algorithms.

### Current Features

- Node placement tool with adjustable radius.
- Zoom slider to dynamically control map zoom level.
- Simple, responsive user interface with a toolbar and tools panel.

### Planned Features

- Flask or Docker-based backend to run Quantum algorithms using Qiskit.
- Full cloud deployment via AWS or other cloud platforms.

### Example of Node Placement

The screenshot below demonstrates how the user can place nodes on the map, adjusting their radius to suit different needs. Each red circle represents a node placed on the map, with a blue marker represents the mouse cursor.
